# Music Performance Management (Tour Scheduling)

This app is a tool that can be used by a music performance manager to oversee the organization of shows; creating and updating performance schedules for venues,  artists, and their setlists. The project was part of a Databases class at Columbia University. I had a free option to base the project around my personal interests and so I chose to create a simple web-based app that utilizes a database and is focused towards music managers as the users in order to create and manage touring schedules for performances. This is something that would have been useful for me when I produced my high schoolâ€™s annual show in 2017. For data collection, I used the actual performance data from this show since it had ample data with 30+ acts that had 1-3 songs each in their setlist. 

## The database used for this project was hosting by a Columbia University server and has since shutdown. The data used is in the file: 'data.pdf'.
